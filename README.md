# ViewWright

**Design the interface before implementing the widgets.**

ViewWright is a declarative UI-authoring system for expressing what an interface **should be** before committing that design to a concrete GUI toolkit.

It exists to close the gap between product intent and implementation:

```text
requirements
    ↓
screen skeleton
    ↓
semantic UI blueprint
    ↓
visual intent
    ↓
projections (ASCII / concept specification / preview)
    ↓
renderer backend (initially egui)
    ↓
running interface
```

ViewWright is the normative counterpart to [ViewWitness](https://github.com/sguzman/viewwitness):

- **ViewWright specifies.** It describes the interface that should exist.
- **ViewWitness observes.** It describes the interface that actually exists.

They are separate projects with deliberately opposite authority. In time, ViewWright expectations and ViewWitness observations should be comparable without collapsing either model into the other.

## Core principles

1. **Author above the widget level.** ViewWright must describe interface concepts, composition, hierarchy, and intent—not merely serialize egui calls.
2. **TOML is canonical.** Human-readable declarative TOML is the initial source format.
3. **ASCII is a projection, not authority.** ASCII wireframes should be generated from the semantic model for rapid human comprehension.
4. **Visual exploration is first-class.** The model should be usable to derive concept-art specifications and visual previews, while keeping generated imagery non-authoritative.
5. **Backends are projections.** egui is the first renderer, not the ontology of the project.
6. **Screens should be previewable in isolation.** Real application startup must not be required merely to inspect a screen design.
7. **Intent survives implementation.** Design hierarchy, dominance, density, composition, and explicit avoidances should remain machine-readable rather than disappearing into widget code.
8. **No heavy work on the render thread.** Backends must keep rendering responsive; parsing, resolution, asset work, and other heavy operations belong off the UI/render thread.

## What ViewWright owns

ViewWright owns the UI blueprint schema, semantic UI vocabulary, composition primitives, design intent, design tokens, fixture descriptions, projections, backend contracts, the initial egui renderer, and eventually a bridge for exporting expectations to ViewWitness.

It does **not** own application business logic, arbitrary 2D/3D graphics, runtime UI observation, GUI automation, or persistence for the host application.

## Implemented structural foundation

M0 established the first executable vertical slice:

```text
TOML → typed / validated / resolved blueprint
     ├── semantic tree
     ├── ASCII
     └── egui preview
```

M1 added an explicit composition root, recursive nested compositions, fixed vertical sizing, cycle diagnostics, and a semantic document surface. The Project Browser and Reader Workspace now resolve through the same backend-independent composition model.

The current preview can switch between both structural specimens.

## Running the current slice

The repository is a Cargo workspace. Blueprints are parsed, validated, and resolved before the preview enters its render loop:

    cargo test
    cargo run -p viewwright-preview

## Current design work — M2 visual authoring

The next pressure test addresses the original motivation for ViewWright: structurally valid UIs can still be visually awful.

M2 is being designed around a deliberately small semantic visual grammar:

- named color tokens
- a compact type scale
- semantic region surface roles
- border and corner policy
- existing spacing and importance semantics
- a deterministic concept-specification projection

The goal is **not** to recreate CSS. The same authored visual intent should be useful to both egui and concept-art generation without becoming toolkit-specific styling.

## Status

- M0 — accepted
- M1 — accepted
- M2 — visual-authoring design pressure test formalized; implementation not yet started
